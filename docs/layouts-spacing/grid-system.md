## Grid System

In cases where you'd use a grid when laying out a screen, use a fixed grid with `16px` gutters â€“ 12-column on desktop with `128px` margins, 8 column for tablet with `64px` margins, and 4 column for mobile with `24px` margins.

Wherever possible, use the Golden Saction to lay out your grid on marketing pages. In this case, ideally the grid cells will be in the shape of the Golden Saction, better if the layout itself is as well, even if vertical.

In any event, we never overlap images, use color and images to form odd or disruptive shapes, or use gutters to pad sections of Golden Saction grids.
