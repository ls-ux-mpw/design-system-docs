## Shapes

In general, Lovesac tends towards square and rectangular boundaries, and does not implement border radius or natural shapes. There are some situations where circles can be used (sliders, bullet points), but limit their use to only implementations where they can't be avoided.

When using rectangles, Lovesac follows the guideline called the **Golden Saction** â€“ a landscape-oriented rectangle with a 4:3 aspect ratio matching the dimensions of our Sactionals Seat. This is used most frequently for images, but we attempt to use it wherever is possible and appropriate.
