Lovesac requires that all digital designs conform to WCAG Level AA standards in order that anyone, regardless of physical limitations, can interact with our products and experience Total Comfort. Code in the Components section of this document has WCAG- and WAI-ARIA-specific attributes baked in, but we also strive for Accessibility in page composition and overall functionality. The below list (borrowed in large part from [wuhcag.com](https://www.wuhcag.com/wcag-checklist/)) contains the big-picture standards we expect across our digital presence:



* Provide text alternatives for non-text content, and alternative to video-only and audio-only content and video with audio.
*	Provide captions for videos with audio.
* Page is constructed in a semantic, logical, meaningful structure that's accessible by keyboard only. Keyboard focus is visible and clear.
*	Use more than one sense for instructions.
*	Don’t use presentation that relies solely on color.
*	Don’t play audio automatically.
*	Don’t trap keyboard users.
*	Time limits have user controls.
*	Provide user controls for moving content.
*	No content flashes more than three times per second.
*	Provide a ‘Skip to Content’ link wherever appropriate.
*	Use helpful and clear page titles, headings, and labels.
*	Every link’s purpose is clear from its context.
*	Each page has a language assigned.
*	Elements do not change when they receive input or focus.
*	Clearly identify input errors, and suggest fixes when users make errors.
*	Build all elements for accessibility -- label elements and give instructions wherever possible.
*	No major code errors may be present; take all necessary steps to reduce the risk of input errors for sensitive data.
*	Contrast ratio between text and background is at least 4.5:1. Where the contrast ratio is 3:1 (AA Large), text must be at least `18px` in medium weights or `14px` if bold. No contrast ratio between text and background should fall below 3:1.
* Text can be resized to 200% without loss of content or function
*	Don’t use images of text
*	Offer several ways to find pages
*	Use navigation, menus, icons, and buttons in a consistent way
