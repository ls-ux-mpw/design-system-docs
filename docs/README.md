# Lovesac Design System

Lovesac's Design System is meant to ensure WCAG Compliance, uniform branding, and consistency in UI patterns across our many digital channels. Its primary use case is web and mobile-native UI, although it also applies to splash pages, social media, and email marketing.

Currently a work in progress -- we have defined token-level design standards, and will soon be applying these to components.
