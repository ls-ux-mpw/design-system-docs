# Lovesac Design System

Lovesac's Design System is meant to ensure WCAG Compliance and consistency across our many channels. Its primary use case is for web and native mobile UI, although it also applies to marketing pages, emails, and social media where slightly more creative freedom is allowed within WCAG's bounds.

Currently a work in progress -- we have defined token-level design standards, and will soon be applying these to components.
