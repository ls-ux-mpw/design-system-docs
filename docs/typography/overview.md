## Museo Sans
![Museo Sans](museo-sans.svg)

Museo Sans is our primary functional font, and the one we use almost exclusively in our online presence. 300 weight is used almost exclusively, 500 for inline links and emphasis, 700 **very rarely** for extreme emphasis. 100 and 900 weight are never used. Line height should be set to 1.4 for body copy (18px and below) and 1.2 for headers and large text.



## Miller Display
![Miller Display](miller-display.svg)

Miller Display only appears in our brand as Miller Display Roman, and should only be used for page headers and major central `h1`s.



## Colors, Modifiers, and Special Uses

By default, text on a neutral background should be in Charcoal, with the exception of inline links or active text buttons (which are Lovesac Teal). Text over banner images is always white, which images are designed to accommodate for -- never use text in an image in web unless it's unavoidable or specifically for adornment. Text on top of any brand greys or primary colors should be white.
